## 🔌 EV Charging Demand Prediction

**Forecast EV charging demand** using machine learning to optimize station use and support sustainable mobility.

### Objective
- Predict future charging load from historical session data, weather, calendar, and location info.

### Approach
1. **Data**: Historical charging logs + external factors (weather, holidays, time of day).  
2. **Models**: ARIMA/Prophet, Random Forest/XGBoost, LSTM.  
3. **Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R².  
4. **Visualization**: Demand heatmaps & time‑series plots.

### Impact
- Improves station planning and load balancing  
- Reduces wait times and energy waste  
- Enables smarter, greener cities
